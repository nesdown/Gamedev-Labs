This game has been developed as an outsourcing project for Z-Digital Group Company.

This is an exact copy of Slither.io game, with a little update: it is needed to ay for the entrance during the game. All the players can eat each others, share food, etc.

##Technologies:
We have started with Phaser on it. Then, when we got to a fact that nothing works well over the Phaser and it is impossible to finish the game that way, we moved to the vanilla canvases - and it worked! The game is still in beta, but there are some pretty interesting things to go.
