      <p>MoneySnake is a classic snake in a new guise. The task is still unchanged:
      you need to collect food, grow and grow in size. But not everything is as simple as it seems!
      In the arena - a myriad of rivals who pursue exactly the same goals, and not
      stop at nothing to achieve their goal. This is a world in which everyone for himself -
      but the winner takes everything and no less!<br>
      Every player here carries a certain amount. Each unit of food has a real dollar equivalent. Your
      the snake turns into a tailed wallet - and the more you collect by eating and destroying
      opponents - the more pay you get. Earnings are more than real - and
      getting them is much easier than it sounds!<br>
      Players can accelerate, clamp each other into loops, adjust traps, cooperate with each other and
      much more. All you need to start the game is to contribute
      entry fee of one dollar, choose a name and appearance.<br>
      Your balance and contributions of other players are scattered on the map in the form of food at startup. From this
      of the moment, each for itself - and how much you will earn by eating everything in its path,
      it is up to you. Be careful, because losing everything is as easy as getting it
      - because if one of the players turns out to be quicker, forcing you to crash into it, your
      the character will turn into another pile of coins - and you have to start from scratch.
      You can earn an unlimited amount, but to withdraw it to
      own account, it is enough to exit the match, having previously moved to a safe
      other players distance.<br>
      Hundreds of players and opportunities await their winner. Get started now - and prove
      that you are a born leader!  After all, MoneySnake is your game. Your drive and excitement. And yours
      unlimited source of income. Do not hesitate? Then full speed ahead! </p>
